From [Jacobs blog](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/jhook/archive/2006/12/facelets
_1112_u.html).

> Facelets 1.1.12 was just uploaded to Java.net and includes many small bug
fixes for JSF 1.1 (MyFaces 1.1.4) and JSF 1.2 (RI 1.2_03b5).

[Download Here ](https://facelets.dev.java.net/files/documents/3448/44872/face
lets-1.1.12.zip)

This release is considered 'draft' until users call it stable for production
use. More information is found over at Facelets' web site.

If you have missed out on facelets for any reason, now is the time to check it
out (but I can't for the love of * find a decent release note on this
particular release)

Edit: [Matt](http://raibledesigns.com/) kindly points me to the [release note]
