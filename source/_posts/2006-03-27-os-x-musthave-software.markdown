This post is mostly for my own recognition, but it might interest some of my
readers (potential OS X switchers come to mind).

I will try to list the "must-have" applications on your fresh OS X, it's been
a while since switched (although I still use various Linux distros regulary).

Here goes

* [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com) - Good IM client, supports alot of protocols. (nice integration with growl to)
* [Backup](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/backup.html) - Apples backup software, quite good. I use this for daily/weekly backups to a external hard-drive
* [Bluephone Elite](http://www.reelintelligence.com/BluePhoneElite/) - Combined with Growl, displays caller id. mutes itunes, dial directly from the app.. Well worth the bucks
* [Chicken of the VNC](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/) - VNC Client
* [Cocoamysql](http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/) - MySQL frontend, used in conjunction with the tools availible from mysql.com
* [Fink](http://fink.sourceforge.net/) - Install/manage installations (kind of like APT)
* [Fugu](http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/) - SCP client
* [Growl](http://growl.info/) - Global notification system, I have several plugins activated (mail, itunes etc)
* [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) - Apple's version of powerpoint, presentation tool done right!
* [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) - Great RSS client, I use it in conjunction with [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) (yes, it supports fetching of your bloglines subscription). I keep all my subcriptions at Bloglines, that way I always have updated subscriptions.
* [Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/) - Nice tool (allot like MS Visio), good for the occasional non-UML diagram (like org. charts etc)
* [Pathfinder](http://www.cocoatech.com/pf4/) - Finder replacement, filemanagement done right.. well worth the bucks!
* [Remote Desktop Connection](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=remotedesktopclient) - Connect to MS terminal servers
* [Salling Clicker](http://www.salling.com/Clicker/mac/) - Bluetooth remote tool, very handy for controling keynotes
* [skEdit](http://www.skti.org/skEdit.php) - A good html-editor
* Stuffit (For extracting files, mostly the occasionaly .sit file)
* [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/) - My texteditor of choice, also incorporates nice colaboration features.
* [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/) - Ftp client, really good
* [Virtue](http://tonyarnold.com/) - Virtual Desktop manager
* [VLC](www.videolan.org/vlc/) - All purpose media-playerDevtools such as IDE's, app-servers and such are left out.. :) I believe my readers will know what and were to get them.. And I have probably missed some software.
