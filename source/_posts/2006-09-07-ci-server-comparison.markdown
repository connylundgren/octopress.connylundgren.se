Found out that [IBM developerworks](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java
/library/j-ap09056/index.html?ca=drs-) has posted an article comparing CI
(Continuous Integration) servers. The products tested are
[CruiseControl](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/),
[Luntbuild](http://luntbuild.javaforge.com/), and
[Continuum](http://maven.apache.org/continuum/). Sadly I miss a feature-by-
feature comparison of the product. I have used CruiseControl and Luntbuild in
the past (the later just very briefly). I've been hoping to take Continuum for
a spin, and perhaps it's about time.
