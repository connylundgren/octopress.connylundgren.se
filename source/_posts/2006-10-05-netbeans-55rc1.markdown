Over at Netbeans Project the
[RC1](http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/download.php?type=5.5rc1) of
Netbeans5.5 has surfaced, hopefully this means that the final 5.5 release is
just behind the corner.

Lately I have been using Netbeans quite a bit for some personal/of hours
projects, and being a longtime Eclipse user the transition has been pretty
smooth (although I still prefer Eclipse over Netbeans).
