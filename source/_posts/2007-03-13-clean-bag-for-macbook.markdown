It seams that I forgot to mention I picked up a
"[BlackBook](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/6
954001/wo/gg3bhJIQbOtQ2Kuq7nv1zQ5ajN6/10.?p=0)" when I were on vacation to
Florida recently, I can’t believe how much cheaper the hardware is”over
there”. This far I am really impressed, it is plenty fast (upgraded to 2gigs
of RAM) and perfect size. Finally I can use a laptop on the weekly flights.

But one thing is missing, I picked up a [Incase
Neoprene](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-
APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=6C04E172&nplm=TJ702LL%2FA) case
at the same time I bought the computer (only thing available at the Apple
Store, and only in not so nice ugly Red). But I really want a clean looking
bag to go with it (no crumpler) preferably in black leather. I can’t seam to
find a decent looking shoulder bag; the ACME made is pretty nice but not what
I’m looking for.

Any tips on a good looking bag/case?
