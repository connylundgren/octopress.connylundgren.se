Posted yesterday were the JSR316, or the umbrella JSR for EE 6. (well it was
posted as JSR313 a while ago). So the news?

Included "new" JSRs

  * [196](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=196)
  * [236](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=236)
  * [237](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=237)
  * [299](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299)
  * [311](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311)
As well as updated versions of EJB, JPA, Servlet, JSF, JAX-WS, and the Java EE
Connector API.

Good news nonetheless.
