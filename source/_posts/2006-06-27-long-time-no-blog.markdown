Well, were to begin. It’s been a long time since my last post; this is because
my server blew up (not literary though, only the motherboard, psu and both of
the drives in the RAID1 set). Since I had my ass full both work wise and
private it took a lot of weekends and nights to restore everything. Well, what
have I been up to since my last post?

  

  * Visited JavaOne back in May
  * Received a new work laptop, a Dell D610 (running Ubuntu a more thorough post will follow on this one)
  * Worked insane hours
  * Spent some evening’s prototyping with EJB3/Jboss Seam.
  * Watched a lot of World Cup football :)
  * Enjoyed the spring/early summer (including a Swedish midsummer)
  * Switched from Blojsom to Wordpress (not entirely finished yet) 
  * .. and probably a lot more

It’s good to be back
