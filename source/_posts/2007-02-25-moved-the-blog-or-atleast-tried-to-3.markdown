I started to move my blog yesterday, from my own hosting to a shared hosting
on [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/) (heard allot of good things about
them, and as a bonus the have hosted SVN servers). I canÂ´t remember the last
time I used a provider to host things, but i guess it were 10 years ago :).

Well things could have been going smoother, I changed the DNS at my registrar
last night before hitting the sack and expected to be up and running when i
woke up this morning. Guess what, my Dreamhost experience started out pretty
rough (to say the least), they have had some serious downtimes all day. Well I
guess these things happens, I will give them a spin and evaluate their
services.
