Sun has released a preview version of the [Java EE 5
SDK](http://java.sun.com/javaee/%3Cbr%3E%3C/a%3E), and on the same time an
[Enterprise Pack for NetBeans.](http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/j
senterprise/tpr/index.html)

From what I can tell the Java EE 5 SDK is just a frozen version of the open
source Glassfish appserver rebranded to "Sun Java System Application Server
Platform Edition 9" which includes features such as EJB3, JSF 1.2, JAXB 2.0,
Java Persistance, JSTL 1.2, Streaming API (StAX), Webservice Metadata.

The SDK is still branded beta, since the
[spec](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220%3Cbr%3E%3C/a%3E) hasnâ€™t reached
final yet.

At the same time [ Enterprise Pack for NetBeans](http://developers.sun.com/pro
dtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/index.html) has been released, and includes
some new features such as support for the above SDK, UML and Visual Design
Tools for SOA Architects (whatever that is) and the appserver bundled.
