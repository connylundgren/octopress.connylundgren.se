Following fast on the CR1 release of Jboss Seam is a fix of several issues,
among these the ability to run the booking example on Glassfish (Running on
Glassfish in the past has been possible, but have required some work).

From [Gavins](http://blog.hibernate.org/cgi-
bin/blosxom.cgi/2006/12/01#seam-1.1cr2) blog

> Seam 1.1.0.CR2 fixes a number of minor bugs in the CR1 release, and adds
some minor improvements. This release includes a version of the booking
example application which deploys on GlassFish, the Java EE 5 reference
implementation, along with the "hibernate2" and "jpa" examples which run
cross-platform on JBoss 4 (with or without EJB3), GlassFish and Tomcat out of
the box, and which may be made to run on any J2EE 1.4 compliant application
server. The ICEfaces example has been upgraded to ICEfaces 1.5.1.
