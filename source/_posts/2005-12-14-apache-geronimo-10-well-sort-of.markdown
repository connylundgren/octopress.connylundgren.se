Apache Software Foundation issued a
[pressrelase](http://www.apachenews.org/archives/000807.html) stating the
release of Geronimo 1.0, although going to the [Geronimo
site](http://geronimo.apache.org/) gives you a quote.

> **Geronimo 1.0 Release Pending**

If you're coming here regarding the press release about the 1.0 release of
Geronimo, that release came out a bit too soon. The Geronimo team would like
you to know that it is very close, but it hasn't quite finished cooking yet. "

At the same time a couple of products used by Geronimo have been incorporated
into the Apache Incubator, these include

  * ActiveMQ - a JMS-compliant enterprise messaging platform
  * OpenEJB - a modular, configurable, and extendable EJB Container System and EJB Server
  * ServiceMix - a JBI-based enterprise service bus and SOA toolkit
  * WADI - a clustering, load-balancing and fail-over solution
  * XBean - a plug-in-based server framework, analogous to the Eclipse plug-in-based, IDE framework
Geronimo is a interesting piece of software, I really hope it will succeed.
