Tom Ball is [bloging](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tball/archive/2006/08/is_wr
iting_code.html) if writing code while being a senior software engineer is
limiting your career advancements. This got me thinking, I agree with Tom that
this can be a limitation in manager eyes, the question is why?

My point of view is to be a successful senior engineer/architect I really need
to know the stuff is really works, how else can I make suggestions on
implementation, framework choices and so on? And I also love writing code and
managing teams/doing design & architecture.

Is this really a leftover from the old way of doing software (i.e. waterfall)
when you sat down and worked out all design? I really dislike just (only?)
spitting out UML and documents/guidelines, sadly allot of architecture/senior
positions seems to be just that.

So is the question is, is there a place for a coding engineer/architect?
