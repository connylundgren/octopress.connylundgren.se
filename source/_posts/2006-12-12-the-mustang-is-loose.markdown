In case you might have missed, Sun released [Java SE
6](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/) today; full details of Java SE 6 are
available on java.sun.com. The umbrella [JSR
270](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=270) covers the key features of this
release.

So will you be upgrading? I will for sure (to be perfectly honest I have been
running the beta for quite some while, and the experience for desktop use is
much better than Java SE 5). For the Enterprise stack I don’t se any urgent
needs to upgrade (the adaptation of Java SE 5 isn’t at full speed yet)
