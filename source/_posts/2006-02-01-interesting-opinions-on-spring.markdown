Bob posted an interesting article about Spring, a good post showing not only
the good things about Spring but also the less beautiful sides. A recommended
reading if you missed the Spring hype.

**Edit:** There is a good amount of blog taking Spring into defence, Dionâ€™s post seems like the most reasonable one.
