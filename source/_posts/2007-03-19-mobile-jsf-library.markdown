Ericsson (yes, not Sony Ericsson) surely surprised me with the release of a
framework called [Mobile JSF Kit ](http://www.ericsson.com/mobilityworld/sub/o
pen/technologies/open_development_tips/tools/mobile_jsf_kit), the kit comes
complete with documentation.

Quote from the site

> The Mobile JSF (JavaServer Faces) Kit consists of the MobileFaces core
library, a developer's guide and sample applications to help Java EE
developers to rapidly develop internet mobile applications.

Skimming through the doc it seems to contain quite allot of nice features,
like detecting devices although it especially states that detecting screen
size are not possible.

So is the time right to face your enterprise app to the mobile platform? This
certainly could make things easier.
