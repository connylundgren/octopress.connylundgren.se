NetBeans.org has finally released NetBeans IDE 5.0 Final. The link is to the
announcement on Javalobby. If you are using NetBeans 4.1, you need to upgrade
now. The difference is just incredible. Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA now have
some serious competition to worry about and Matisse puts them all to shame.
Peronaly im not a dedicated Netbeans user, but this might just make me take a
closer look.
