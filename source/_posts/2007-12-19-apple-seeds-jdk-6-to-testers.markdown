Finally, after months of silence something about the JDK6 for OS X has
surfaced. According to [Macrumors.com](http://www.macrumors.com/2007/12/18
/apple-seeds-mac-os-x-10-5-2-and-java-se-6-preview-8-for-leopard/) apple
seeded Java SE 6 Preview 8 for Leopard yesterday evening. According to the
report it’s Java SE 6 version 1.6.0_01, and apparently requires a 64-bit
capable Intel-mac. So there is still room for ranting about the support for
PPC platform.

I for one think it’s wonderful news to get support for JDK6, not so much for
development purposes but for the improved performance and some random goodies
included in the JDK.

**Update:** Apparently Apple also made [Java SE 6 Developer Preview 8](http://developer.apple.com/java/) available from the ADC site today. Go grab it, and stop complaining..
