My Sony Ericsson P910 phone died early this spring, and was hastily replaced
by non smart phone (a Motorola Razr V3x) since SE hadn't released their P990.

Well, I have nothing to complain on with the Razr technically, but I am
seriously missing allot of the features of my P910 (like descent calendars,
qwerty-keyboard, good email support and so on). I am looking for a replacement
for the Razr, I think I have come down to 2 alternatives namely the SE M600I
and the (Finally released) P990.

I am currently leaning towards the M600, since I never use the camera and the
smaller form-factor of the M600 seems nice. Currently none of the devices have
support for iSync but I bet support will follow shortly.

I have surfed the net for advice, and for the P990 there isn't that much
information (the only started shipping this week), and the M600 seems to be
suffering from somewhat buggy software (although i suspect the P990 has the
same problems since it's built on the same platform). Also it seems somewhat
hard to get your hands on the P990.

Do anyone have any experience with either of the devices, all feedback is
appreciated.
