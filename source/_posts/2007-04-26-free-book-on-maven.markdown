about the release of his free book on Maven.

> Thats right, there is a [new guide](http://www.sonatype.com/book/) out there
to help all those interested in [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (or already
using it) to get the most out of their build lifecycle. It is indeed the
definitive guide and will be regularly updated so it stays that way. This book
is produced by my colleges at [Sonatype](http://sonatype.com/) and is a free
gift to the Maven community - no registration, no catches. From the front of
our site:

Sure, there has been articles around for maven previous, but not as "complete"
as this. It made it to my bookmarks anyway.
