Read it on [Matt
Raible’s](http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?entry=re_oracle_donates_adf_faces)
blog, apparently Oracle [has decided to donate](http://www.it-
eye.nl/weblog/2005/12/12/apache-myfaces-and-apache-faces-cherokee/) their JSF
implementation ([ADF Faces](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htd
ocs/partners/addins/exchange/jsf/index.html)) to the [Apache
Faces](http://myfaces.apache.org/) project.

JSF is quite cool, even though I haven’t had the time to play around with it
as much as for e.g. Tapestry, but I believe for it to take momentum we need to
see a nice ecosystem of components (commercial and open), that’s the whole
point about a component based framework. Another point is that JSF seems to be
designed around RAD development, I am not sure how good the tools are these
days but it seems to be catching up. I believe if JSF should take a hard spot
on the framework map we need the RAD tools (at least to catch the “corporate
developer” coming from a background such as VB/.NET). Hopefully I will have
the opportunity to form a tighter opinion about JSF in the near future since
my current project uses/starting to use JSF.
