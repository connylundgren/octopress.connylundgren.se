News.com had a quick [report](http://news.com.com/Ubuntu+maker+to+distribute+S
uns+Java/2110-7344_3-6133411.html) (well no real information there) that
[Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) (the commercial interest behind Ubuntu)
and Sun has partnered to include the
[Glassfish](https://glassfish.dev.java.net/) Java EE server in the Ubuntu
Server product, I think this is a nice thing to do, and hopefully it will be
up there competing with the RedHat/Jboss stack ([Red Hat Application
Stack](http://www.redhat.com/solutions/rhappstack/)).

At this time I think that glassfish is more bleeding edge than Jboss, and
perhaps the only real "final" Java EE server ready for production (Although I
argue that the JBoss AS is real stable and production-ready as-well).
