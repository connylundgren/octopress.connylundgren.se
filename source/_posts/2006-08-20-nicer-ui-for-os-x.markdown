OS X seems to be moving away from the 3D design of OSX in Leopard, but you can
theme your system today with a nice app called
[UNO](http://gui.interacto.net/) which unifies the LAF of your system. (Works
much like [Irridium X](http://sagefire.org/category/software/iridium/), but
seems to be more complete in theming iApps, Mozilla apps and so on)

Im not really into theming my OS, but the shake-and-mix of UIs in OSX really
nags me.
