IBM today released a product called WebSphere Application Server Community
Edition (or WAS CE for short)

The product is based on GlueCode (which where acquired by IBM this summer),
and technically it's based on Apacher Geronimo According to the IBM marketing
fuzz

> "WAS CE features a small footprint, making it easier to download and manage.
Based on core open source technology from the J2EE-certified Apache Geronimo
application server, WAS CE and related subscription support provide a flexible
and affordable alternative to traditional commercial software offerings and
can help customers begin to deploy a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)."

The initiative seems nice, but not a really surprising move considering IBM's
flirting with the Open Source Movement lately.

I guess i have to put it on my "to test"-list. Hopefully the quite good admin
console from WAS has made it over.
