Marc Fleury blogged about some groundbreaking news to be revealed, the
pressrelease surfaced today.

Pardon me, but I am not that impressed. Integration with windows? Sure it's a
nice feature, but does JBoss on Windows really have a significant install
base? And do you really want to tie you applications to yet another
Proprietary system like Active Directory? Oh well I guess it doesn't hurt, but
I am not impressed... pressrelease
