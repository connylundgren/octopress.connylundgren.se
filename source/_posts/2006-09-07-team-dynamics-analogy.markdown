Found an interesting post over at [Darren
Hobbs](http://www.darrenhobbs.com/archives/2006/09/yet_another_ana.html) blog
about adding more team members to a project. Good analogy, if only the
managers would catch on.

today that software projects are like turkeys.

> You can't achieve the same effect when roasting a turkey by doubling the
temperatuire and halving the cooking time. Similarly a project cannot have the
number of people doubled and the duration halved and get the same result. The
rate of knowledge crunching is not increased by adding more people.
