I’ve been looking into replacing my now somewhat aging 17” powerbook (1,67Ghz,
2GB RAM), although the Pb is really nice (big screen, reasonably fast) it
suffers from a couple of drawbacks.

  

  * **To cumbersome** – I have been air-commuting for the last year, and the 17” is a bit to big to use and to carry around. 
  * **Development Performance** – Using it to as my development machine of choice, the performance has begun to lag behind. It has really started to get on my nerves, mostly the compile/deploy cycle of Java EE development (Netbeans/Eclipse, JBoss AS/Weblogic)
  * **Slow Virtual PC** – I still need to access/use some windows software, not that often but the VirtualPC performance is sub par.
So my plan is to replace it shortly after Christmas, I were dead set on
replacing it with a 15” MacBook Pro, but lately I have been beginning to
wonder if the MacBook would fit the bill (I plan to hook either on up to a 23”
Cinema Display and keyboard/mouse when developing at home) and recent blog
post such as [this ](http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/05/are_you_macboo
k_or_are_you_pro.html)added further decision frustration to the mix.

Any suggestions/recommendations? Is the MacBook good enough, or should I pay
the extra premium to get the Pro?
