MySQL has release version 5.0 of their RDB today, and I must say finding
what's new wasn't the easiest task around. The whitepaper kicks you straight
to a registration page...

Has MySQL forgotten their roots?

I wonder how long it will be until the Hibernate-project has implemented
support for 5.0, I am guessing just a couple of days.
