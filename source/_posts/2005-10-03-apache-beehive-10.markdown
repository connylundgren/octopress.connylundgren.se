> A few notes about this release:

> * WSM and the web service control are not included as WSM has not passed the
JSR 181 TCK yet. Both will be available in a subsequent release.

> * v1.0 does not include XMLBeans due to licensing issues with the JSR 173
API JAR; however, XMLBeans can still be used with Beehive and is available
from http://xmlbeans.apache.org
