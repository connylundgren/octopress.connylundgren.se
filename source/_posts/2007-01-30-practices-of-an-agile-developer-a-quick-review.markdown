I've had this book laying around for some months, and because of time
constraints I haven't had the time to read it. Even if i consider myself quite
“Agile” the book gives you quite a lot of insight into practices you haven't
used before, or it even serves as a stamp of approval to verify what your
doing is the “right” thing.

I'm a big fan of the Pragmatic Programmers books, they seem just right (in
terms of sheer size, and content) nowadays I seldom run through a 700+ pages
book just to get up on speed on technology, I much prefer to have a short
(200pages or so) introduction and this lets me get on with investigate further
by myself.

So the practices then, I found some new that I haven't used before that I will
try to implement in future (and present) projects.

I highly recommend this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Practices-Agile-
Developer-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/097451408X/sr=8-1/qid=1170147390/ref=pd_bbs
_sr_1/104-5617556-8995921?ie=UTF8&s=books) to everyone claiming to be Agile,
or want to be more Agile.
