The following is quite old by now, but still get its point throughâ€¦

> 10. 'That's weird...' 9. 'It's never done that before.' 8. 'It worked
yesterday.' 7. 'You must have the wrong version.' 6. 'It works, but it hasn't
been tested.' 5. 'Somebody must have changed my code.' 4. 'Did you check for a
virus?' 3. 'Where were you when the program blew up?' 2. 'Why do you want to
do it that way?'

And finally...

> 1. 'I thought I fixed that.'
