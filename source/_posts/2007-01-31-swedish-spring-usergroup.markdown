Good to see things are moving here in Sweden aswell. (snipet from [http://www.
springframework.org/node/408](http://www.springframework.org/node/408))

> The Sweden Spring User Group has been founded. The group will be backed by
[Jayway](http://www.jayway.se/), the leading Java house in Sweden. The goal is
to arrange activities and seminars, and exchange information, experiences and
opinions about the Spring framework and other related technologies. The User
Group is available at [http://groups.google.com/group/swedenspring](http://gro
ups.google.com/group/swedenspring). The communication in the group is in
Swedish. We are looking forward to meet you there and have a lot of
interesting discussions!
