At last we arrived to San Francisco and this years installation of [Java
One](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp), the flight over meant a
dreaded stop at [Heathrow terminal
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Terminal_5_station)5, all in all a
quite terrible experience but to our surprise the bags arrived safely. The
weather is pretty cold and chilly winds (especially considering that we spent
3 wonderful sunny and war days in
[Budapest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell√©rt_Baths) before heading over);
hopefully it will get better tomorrow.
