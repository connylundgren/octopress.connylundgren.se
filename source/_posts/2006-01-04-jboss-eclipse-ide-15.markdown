The JBoss Group has announced the release of version 1.5 of their JBoss
Eclipse IDE project. "The new features since 1.4.1 are too many to count, We
suggest you take a look at the changelogs and release notes for all the
previous milestones and release candidates to get a feel."

I realy hope they have finaly fixed the oh-so buggy hibernate-tools!
