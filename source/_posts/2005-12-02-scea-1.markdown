**Cleared SCEA part 1**  
After a slow start I took the plunge and booked a time for part one of SCEA
(Sun Certified Enterprise Architect). For those of you not familiar with SCEA
the exam is made up of three parts, where the first one is a standard multiple
choice exam. Once you have completed part 1 you can continue to the "guts" of
the certification which is architecture based on the requirements you receive.

I have started the analysis work of part 2, and I must say that the
requirements are as fuzzy as real world requirements often are.
