After a series of betas & RCâ€™s the browser of my choice
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox) released 1.5 today.

Among the news is automatic updates, faster browsing (whatever that means),
better tab handling (finally the possibility to move tabs around!), better OSX
support.

First impressions are good, still some minor issues though, it mostly seems
related to my folderorg script when downloading files.
