Jetbrains announced a milestone release for my favorite IDE a couple of days
ago, and the feature list is quite impressing. I have been running the
milestone for a couple of days and so far it's running great. The SEAM support
is a winner for me, as the Spring 2.5 support (although it worked fine in
7.0.4 as well)

  * JBoss Seam Integration
  * Javascript/Flex Debugger
  * Spring 2.5
  * FreeMarker, Velocity, GWT 1.5
  * Great support for REST WebServices
  * Struts 2
  * Multi-dialect SQL Console
  * Reworked project configuration
  * New automated refactorings
  * Improved coding assistance
  * Numerous new code inspections
  * Countless other new features and improvements
And planned features for the full version

  * Team Foundation Server integration
  * New Java refactorings from former Refactor-J
  * Improved Groovy support, with Grails 1.0.3 and new refactorings
  * Improved Ruby support, with Ruby debugger
  * Scala support
  * Python support
  * Flexible settings storage with IntelliJ IDEA Server
