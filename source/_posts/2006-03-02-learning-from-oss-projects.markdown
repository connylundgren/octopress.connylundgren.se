The O'Reilly website onlamp.com has a really interesting article out about
what "corporate" projects can learn from open source dittos, I found the
article really interesting and there are allot of recognition-points in there.
Worth reading, and I immediately ordered the book which the article reefers
to.

It all boils down to five important point, namely.

* Tell the truth all the time 
* Trust the team 
* Review everything, test everything 
* All developers are created equal 
* The fastest way through the project is to do it right  
I know I will try to integrate more of the tips into my projects, and
definitely try to stand up against the "management" more.
