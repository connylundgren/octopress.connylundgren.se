Tor Norbye points out that Milestone 11 of NetBeans Performance Profiler now
supports OS X. As you might know the profiler is based on JFluid.

You will need JDK 5 update 4 for this to work.

I will have to take it for a spin, but I was quite impressed by the demo of
the profiler I saw on this year JavaOne.
