The guidelines I follow for publishing anything are:

  * It’s publicly available info (i.e., I never post anything you can’t find on the net by yourself)
  * It’s useful to me, right now or in the future
  * It has something to do with my work, hobbies or the general “tech-world”
  * It’s not directly related to work - I never post anything directly related to my work, projects, company or suppliers, except if it’s out in the public already.
Finally, in case the above does not make it absolutely clear, my views do not
reflect that of my past, present, or future employers. What I post is my
opinion. This is, after all, my blog.
